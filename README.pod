=head1 NAME

Test::Mini::Unit - Declarative Sugar for Test::Mini

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Test::Mini::Unit aims to provide a simpler, boilerplate-free environment
for writing new L<<<< S<<<<< Test::Mini >>>>>|Test::Mini >>>> test
cases.  While Test::Mini itself is a fairly reasonable environment with
very little overhead verbosity, the overhead of creating a new class --
or set of classes -- in Perl can still be a bit more distracting than
you'd really like.

=head2 Enter Test::Mini::Unit

At first glance, Test::Mini::Unit provides moderate improvements over
the traditional style, transforming this:

  package t::Test
  use base 'Test::Mini::TestCase';
  use strict;
  use warnings;

  use Test::Mini::Assertions;

  sub setup {
      # do something
  }

  sub test_some_code {
      assert($something_true);
  }

  sub teardown {
      # undo something
  }

  1;

Into this:

  use Test::Mini::Unit;

  case t::Test {
      setup {
          # do something
      }

      test some_code {
          assert($something_true);
      }

      teardown {
          # undo something
      }
  }

But Test::Mini::Unit really begins to shine as your test cases take on
more complexity.  Multiple calls to the test advice methods (C<<<< setup
>>>> and C<<<< teardown >>>>) will stack like C<<<< BEGIN >>>> and C<<<<
END >>>> blocks, allowing you to co-locate tests and relevant advice.

  # Traditional
  sub setup {
      # do a bunch of setup for test_one
      # ...
      # do a bunch of setup for test_two
      # ...
  }

  sub test_one { ... }
  sub test_two { ... }

  # Test::Mini::Unit
  setup { "do setup for test_one" }
  sub test_one { ... }

  setup { "do setup for test_two" }
  sub test_two { ... }

Per-test local storage is automatically available as C<<<< $self >>>>
from all advice and test blocks.

   setup { $self->{data} = Package->new() }
   test data { assert_isa($self->{data}, 'Package') }

   teardown { unlink $self->{tmpfile} }

And perhaps most usefully, test cases can be B<<<< nested >>>>.  Nested
test cases inherit all their outer scope's test advice, allowing you to
build richer tests with far less code.

  case t::IO::Scalar {
      setup { $self->{buffer} = IO::Scalar->new() }
      test can_read  { assert_can($self->{buffer}, 'read')  }
      test can_write { assert_can($self->{buffer}, 'write') }
      test is_empty  { assert_empty("@{[$self->{buffer}]}") }

      case AfterWritingString {
          setup { $self->{buffer}->print('String!') }
          test contents { assert_equal("@{[$self->{buffer}]}", 'String!') }
      }

      case AfterWritingObject {
          setup { $self->{buffer}->print($self) }
          test contents { assert_equal("@{[$self->{buffer}]}", "$self") }
      }
  }
